# 🧠 Bag of Words with Preprocessing and Advanced Features

This project demonstrates a complete text preprocessing and feature extraction pipeline using the **Bag of Words (BoW)** model. It includes advanced text cleaning, normalization, and tokenization techniques designed to prepare raw text data for machine learning models.

## 📌 Overview

This notebook walks through the process of:

- **Loading and sampling** a large text dataset for processing.
- **Preprocessing text** using robust methods including:
  - Lowercasing
  - Symbol and number replacement (e.g., ₹ → rupee, 1000000 → 1m)
  - Decontracting (e.g., *can't* → *can not*)
  - HTML tag removal
  - Regular expression-based cleaning
- **Feature extraction** using:
  - Bag of Words (CountVectorizer)
  - TF-IDF (TfidfVectorizer)
  - Unigrams and bigrams
- **Data visualization** to understand class distribution and token frequencies.

## ✨ Preprocessing Highlights

The `preprocess()` function performs:

- Normalization of currency symbols and large numbers
- Decontraction (e.g., "isn't" → "is not")
- Lowercasing and trimming
- HTML tag stripping using BeautifulSoup
- Regex-based noise removal

```python
def preprocess(q):
    q = str(q).lower().strip()
    q = q.replace('%', ' percent').replace('$', ' dollar ')
    q = q.replace('₹', ' rupee ').replace('€', ' euro ').replace('@', ' at ')
    q = q.replace('[math]', '')
    q = re.sub(r'([0-9]+)000000000', r'\1b', q)
    q = re.sub(r'([0-9]+)000000', r'\1m', q)
    q = re.sub(r'([0-9]+)000', r'\1k', q)
    q = BeautifulSoup(q, 'lxml').get_text()
    q = re.sub(r'[^a-zA-Z]', ' ', q)
    q = re.sub(r'\s+', ' ', q)
    return q
```

## 📊 Visualizations

Add charts to show:

- Distribution of classes/labels
- Top 20 most frequent unigrams and bigrams
- Comparison of CountVectorizer vs TfidfVectorizer outputs

## 🧠 Next Steps

- Add classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes)
- Evaluate using metrics like F1-score, ROC-AUC
- Extend with Word2Vec or transformer-based embeddings (e.g., BERT)
